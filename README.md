Project Title: Data Structures and Algorithms Header File

Abstract:
This project aims to provide a comprehensive library of data structures and algorithms implemented in C++ for developers to use in their projects. It covers a wide range of commonly used data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables, along with essential algorithms including sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and string matching.

The library is designed to be easy to use and integrate into various development environments. Users can simply include the header files corresponding to the data structure or algorithm they need in their C++ projects. Each header file contains class or function declarations along with detailed comments explaining their usage, parameters, and return values. Additionally, the project includes separate implementation files for each algorithm and data structure, making it modular and allowing users to modify or extend the library according to their requirements.

With this library, developers can efficiently leverage well-tested implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms, saving time and effort in coding from scratch. Whether working on small-scale projects or large-scale software development, this library provides a solid foundation for building efficient and robust C++ applications.
